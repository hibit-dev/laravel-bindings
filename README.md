# Interfaces binding with implementations in Laravel
An interface is a programming structure that allows the computer to enforce certain properties on an object. In object oriented programming, an interface generally defines the set of methods that an instance of a class that has that interface could respond to. It is actually a concept of abstraction and encapsulation.

Say we have a car class, a motorcycle class and a bus class. Each of these three classes should have a start engine action. How the engine is started for each vehicle is left to each particular class implementation but the fact is that they all share the action of start engine. In other words, declaring the action in the interface forces all the classes that has the interface to implement that action.

Let's see some practical examples with Laravel. Therefore, PHP is used as programming language.
